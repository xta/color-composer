# Color Composer v0.0.1

Use your keyboard to play around with and visualize colors with HSL (hue-saturation-lightness).

## Usage

Visit [Color Composer](http://xta.github.io/color-composer/) and use your keyboard (QWER, ASDF, and ZXCV) to manipulate the current color. Get the Hex & RGB values.

## About

This tool is a conceptual tool to see what happens when you combine your common color picker with precise keyboard controls to adjust colors in an intuitive way. HSL is a color representation that is easy to reason about. To change the color, adjust the hue between the 360 degrees. To adjust the intensity/greyness, adjust the color's saturation. To make it light or dark, adjust the lightness.
